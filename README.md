# QR-Code Generator
A QR code generator is a program or script that allows you to create QR codes, which are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data, such as URLs, text, contact information, or other data formats. QR codes are widely used in marketing, advertising, and mobile applications for quickly and easily sharing information.
In Python, you can use the qrcode library to generate QR codes. This library provides an easy-to-use interface for creating QR codes with customizable options. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in generating a QR code using Python:

Import the necessary libraries:

qrcode: This library provides the functions and classes to generate QR codes.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): It is used to manipulate and save the generated QR code image.
Create a QRCode object:

Use the qrcode.QRCode() constructor to create an instance of the QRCode class.
Set the desired options for the QR code, such as the version, error correction level, box size, and border.
Add data to the QR code:

Use the add_data() method of the QRCode object to specify the data that you want to encode in the QR code.
The data can be a URL, text, or any other information you want to encode.
Generate the QR code:

Call the make() method of the QRCode object to generate the QR code.
You can pass the fit=True parameter to automatically adjust the size of the QR code based on the data.
Customize the appearance of the QR code:

Optionally, you can customize the appearance of the QR code by setting the fill color and background color using the make_image() method.
You can specify colors using various formats, such as RGB values, color names, or hexadecimal codes.
Save the QR code image:

Use the save() method of the generated image object to save the QR code as an image file.
Provide the desired file name and file format (e.g., PNG, JPEG)
